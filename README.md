# DATA1200-Oblig-2

Denne oppgaven kommer til å gå fint! :)

Preface

This document contains the description of two different tasks(option aand b) for the second compulsory activity of the course. You must only pick one and implement it.

These are all rather simple tasks. So,we expect you to deliver with high quality. The best thing you can do for quality assurance is to find a buddy so you can look through each other's code and give feedback.


Option a –From wireframe to page, summer '21

Context

This task aims to give youa lot of freedom so that you can be creative and do something cool based on a small idea/problem.

Task description

Design sketch and implement a web page to show 6 pictures taken this summer.

Phase 1

  • Select six pictures taken this summer 
  • Create/sketch two wireframes for two different page layouts (mobile phone and large screens)
  • Each wireframe will show the six images together with six short texts describing them

We suggest you do the wireframes on paper and scan them or take a photo of them. However, you can also use any digital tool you like. Figma, Miroor AdobeXDare some popular examples of toolsfor sketching and prototyping.

Phase 2

Implement the web page you have prototyped based on your wireframes. Don’t forget that the page must have two layouts (mobile phone and large screens). Additionally, we ask the following:
    • for the images, use the “picture” element todisplay differently sized pictures for different screen sizes (optionally, you can use the “img” element together with the “srcset” attribute.);
    • the stylesheet(s) should change the properties of the 'p' element and, at least, one 'heading' type between the different screen-sizes.
    • define and use, at least, one 'class';
    • upload the wireframes as picture files and link them in so they open (in new tabs).

Phase 3

Create a “reflextion.html” page and include it in your project. The reflection must:
    • have a maximum of 700 words;
    • describe the parts that were most difficult to translate from wireframe to actual pages;
    • discuss the main challenges you had when implementing the page with regards to its responsive nature (dynamic page that scaled with screen size);
    • explain why you have used "<picture>” or “<img>+srcset attribute”.

If you have nothing to write, you have made it too easy for yourself! It is simple to do this straight forward and boring, and to end up with pages that looks very different from the wireframe. Your challenge to yourself should be to dare to be createive, and work hard to reproduce it as well as you are able.
